To put your SSL certificate in AWS using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), follow the steps below:

1. **Go to Certificate Manager**:
   - Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
   - In the AWS services search bar, type "Certificate Manager" or navigate to the "Security, Identity & Compliance" section and click on "Certificate Manager."

2. **Request Certificate**:
   - Click on the "Request a certificate" button.

3. **Enter Domain Name**:
   - In the "Add domain names" section, enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for which you want to request the SSL certificate, e.g., "example.com" or "*.example.com" for a wildcard certificate.
   - You can add multiple domain names if needed.

4. **Select Validation Method**:
   - Choose the validation method for proving domain ownership:
     - DNS validation (recommended): This method requires you to add a specific DNS record to your domain's DNS configuration to validate ownership. Choose this if you can modify your DNS settings.
     - Email validation: Choose this method if you cannot modify the DNS configuration for the domain and prefer to receive an email to one of the common administrative email addresses (e.g., admin@example.com) for domain validation.

5. **Select Key Algorithm (Optional)**:
   - Choose the encryption algorithm for the SSL certificate. RSA 2048 is commonly used and widely supported.

6. **Add Tags (Optional)**:
   - If desired, you can add tags to the certificate to help manage and organize your resources.

7. **Review and Confirm**:
   - Review the information you provided and click on the "Confirm and request" button.

8. **DNS Validation (if selected)**:
   - If you selected DNS validation, ACM will provide you with a specific DNS CNAME record that you need to add to your DNS configuration. Follow the instructions provided by ACM to add the CNAME record to your domain's DNS settings.

9. **Approval and Validation**:
   - Once you have completed the DNS or email validation process, ACM will attempt to validate your ownership of the domain. This may take a few minutes to complete.
   - If the validation is successful, ACM will issue the SSL certificate for your domain.

10. **Manage Certificates**:
   - Once the certificate is issued, you can manage and view your SSL certificates in the ACM console.

Note: Keep in mind that the exact steps may vary slightly depending on your AWS console version and region.

By following these steps, you can request and obtain an SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager and use it to secure your domains and applications hosted on AWS services like Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, or Amazon API Gateway.
